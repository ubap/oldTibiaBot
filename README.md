# oldTibiaBot
Used for thronia.org<br \>

inject dump_packets_c.dll into Thronia.exe<br \>
it exports some functions of Thronia via named pipes.<br \>

Controller written in C#<br \>
Reads/writes data from Thronia exe using ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMemory.<br \>
Sends commands to thronia via named pipes.<br \><br \>


It's a mess!<br \><br \>

Good luck.<br \>
