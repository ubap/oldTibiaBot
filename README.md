Used for thronia.org<br \>

inject dump_packets_c.dll into Thronia.exe<br \>
it exports some functions of Thronia via local UDP server on port 8888.<br \>

Controller written in C#<br \>
Reads/writes data from Thronia exe using ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMemory.<br \>
Sends commands to thronia on localhost:8888<br \><br \>


It's a mess!<br \><br \>

Good luck.<br \>
